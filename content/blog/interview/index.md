## [How I Passed Coding Interviews at Facebook, Google, Lyft, Bloomberg.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lDTKnzrX6qU)

# A quick recap of this video:
DATA STRUCTURES CONTENT:
Loops and recursion
Arrays and matrices
Linked lists
Queues, stacks, heaps, 
Sets and hash maps,
Trees and binary search,
Graphs,
Depths first search, breadth first search, and backtracking
Tries,
Merge sort and quick sort

OTHER HELPFUL CONTENT:
Dynamic Programming (Memoization and Divide-and-Conquer)
Problems with Multiple Pointers or Sliding Windows
Greedy Algorithms,
Logical/Mathematical proof techniques (contradiction, contrapositive, induction, cases),
Object Oriented Programming (I recommend checking out Clean Code by Robert Martin, especially the sections on Single Responsibility Principle. Not SUPER important for interviews, but very good to know).

RESOURCES:
Even if you don't go to any of these colleges, might as well copy the curriculum at top universities, since they have proven to work and the content is mostly public anyway.
CS61B and CS170 at UC Berkeley, 
CS50 at Harvard, 
6.006 at MIT, 
15-121 at Carnegie Mellon,
or the appropriate classes at Waterloo, Stanford, CalTech, Princeton, etc. (not sure what the're called)

Leetcode (I used Premium at times but it isn't necessary):|
https://leetcode.com

Data Structures sections on GeeksForGeeks:

Gayle Laakmann McDowell's video series on Youtube:

I 10/10 recommend this algorithms book (used at UC Berkeley for CS170):

MINDSET:
I think this is the most pretentious and blatantly obvious advice anyone can give, but I think most things in life (unfortunately) come down to this secret formula:
1. Be experienced
2. Know what you're doing
3. Be smart

I'm still figuring these out, but any other approach really only works because you end up just following this secret formula except on accident. I think it's more effective to set these as our end goal and break it down into actionable steps.
